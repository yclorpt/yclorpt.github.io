        My name is Thomas A. Daniels. I study computer science and am a sophomore at Arapahoe Community College where I focus on C++ development.<br><br>

        TSA is a state/national engineering competition I competed in when I was in High-school.
        During my senior year I earned first place at the TSA state competition with an AI medical helper chatbot.
        I took seventh place at the TSA nationals during my junior year with a national bunker concept.
        I also reached Gold Competitor status in CyberPatriot which is a national cybersecurity contest that asks students to secure virtual networks and systems.<br><br>

        Outside of school and contests I love hands on work with technology.
        I spend a lot of time in game development where I learn about gameplay mechanics and graphics programming.
        I am also fascinated by Linux systems. I customized a Arch Linux distribution however the files to this have been lost.<br><br>

        If you need to find me please contact me under my contact page.<br><br>
